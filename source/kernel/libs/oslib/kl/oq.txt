1)	Who calls the ll entries??? If only the OS code can do this,
	the lowlevel doesn't need to protect the mutex regions (this is
	done by the OS). If we want that everyone can call the lowlevel,
	the lowlevel functions must protect the mutex regions by cli/sti
	(warning... save_flags can be needed...)
